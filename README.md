 In today's world, with the rapid growth of technology and especially artificial intelligence, the need for nurturing future startup leaders is more pressing than ever. Many young individuals and eager entrepreneurs are keen to enter this field, but a lack of access to appropriate educational resources and practical experiences can hinder the realization of their innovative ideas. For this reason, we have decided to establish a business school specifically for startups that focuses on artificial intelligence, with the aim of preparing entrepreneurs to create value and launch successful ventures.

Our school is situated within an AI startup studio that houses over ten active domestic and international startups. This studio serves as a dynamic and creative environment where ideas are transformed into reality. Startups in this space develop industrial and innovative projects, allowing our students to familiarize themselves with real market challenges. Engaging with diverse teams and participating in ongoing projects enables students to gain valuable practical experience and learn the necessary skills for success in the real world.

Our educational program is designed to cover all stages of building and developing a startup. From ideation and market opportunity identification to more complex stages like product development, marketing, fundraising, and team management, each aspect is meticulously examined. We teach students how to convert their ideas into viable business models and utilize artificial intelligence tools to create added value for customers. This comprehensive approach helps students gain a deeper understanding of a startup's life cycle and empowers them to enter the job market with greater confidence.

One of the standout features of our school is its focus on artificial intelligence and its applications in launching startups. Collaborating with industry experts and leading academics, we provide up-to-date educational content tailored to market needs. Students become familiar with the latest trends and technologies and can benefit from the real-life experiences of successful entrepreneurs. These interactions not only enhance theoretical knowledge but also offer effective networking opportunities for students, potentially leading to future business collaborations. We are also committed to supporting selected students in their journey to launch their own startups. Through advisory programs, access to financial and technical resources, and accelerator events, we strive to help individuals turn their ideas into reality. Our goal is to equip students with the tools and resources necessary to create value for society and nurture a new generation of creative and innovative entrepreneurs capable of tackling todayâ€™s challenges. With this approach, we hope to create a supportive ecosystem for startups where entrepreneurs can confidently embark on their paths to success.

Ultimately, we aim to foster a vibrant and creative community of entrepreneurs who can confront the challenges of today's world. Our business school not only focuses on teaching technical and managerial skills but also emphasizes the development of an entrepreneurial spirit, creative thinking, and problem-solving abilities. We believe that by cultivating a new generation of startup leaders, we can contribute to shaping a brighter and more innovative future.
